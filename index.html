            <h2>Who Is Patti Smith?</h2>
            <p>
                Patti Smith is a singer, writer and artist who became a highly influential figure in the New York City
                punk rock scene. After working on a factory assembly line, she began performing spoken word and later
                formed the Patti Smith Group (1974-79). Her most famous album is Horses. Her relationship with Fred
                "Sonic" Smith caused a hiatus in her singing career, but she returned to music after his untimely death
                and later earned acclaim for a series of autobiographical books.
